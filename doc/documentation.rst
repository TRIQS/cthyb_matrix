Documentation
=============

The documentation starts by briefly describing how the algorithm in the solver
works. We illustrate how to use the solver with the example of an Anderson
impurity problem. Then we show a concrete DMFT calculation. The last
sections give a technical description of the class, discuss how to chose
parameters and use different random number generators.
