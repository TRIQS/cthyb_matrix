Installation
============

The continuous-time hybridization-expansion matrix solver is based on the TRIQS library. Therefore
the TRIQS library must be installed on your system (see `<http://ipht.cea.fr/triqs>`_ for details about
TRIQS and on its installation). In the following, we will suppose that TRIQS is installed in
the ``path_to_triqs`` directory.

Installation steps
------------------

#. Download the sources of the solver from github:: 
 
     $ git clone git@github.com:TRIQS/cthyb_matrix.git src
 
#. Create an empty build directory where you will compile the code:: 
 
     $ mkdir build && cd build 
 
#. In the build directory call cmake specifying where the TRIQS library is installed:: 
 
     $ cmake -DTRIQS_PATH=path_to_triqs ../src 
 
#. Compile the code, run the tests and install the application:: 
 
     $ make 
     $ make test 
     $ make install 
 
Version compatibility 
--------------------- 
 
Be careful that the version of the TRIQS library and of the solver must be 
compatible (more information on the `TRIQS website 
<http://ipht.cea.fr/triqs/versions.html>`_). If you want to use a version of 
the solver that is not the latest one, go into the directory with the sources 
and look at all available versions:: 
 
     $ cd src && git tag 
 
Checkout the version of the code that you want:: 
 
     $ git co 1.0.0 
 
Then follow the steps 2 to 4 described above to compile the code.
