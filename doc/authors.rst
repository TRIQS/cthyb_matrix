Authors
=======

The continuous-time hybridization-expansion matrix solver has been written by
M. Ferrero and O. Parcollet with contributions from L. Boehnke. It is based on
a hybridization expansion of the partition function as described in references
[#ctqmc1]_ and [#ctqmc2]_. The computation of the imaginary-time Greenâ€™s
function has been improved with the use of Legendre polynomials following
reference [#ctqmc3]_.
